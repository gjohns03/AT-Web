	Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this guide is to provide principles and standards for creating and publishing content in a single voice and style for your website.</p>
<p>It’s easy for that voice to become fragmented, adopting unique characteristics of whoever is authoring content. With multiple people authoring content, consistency and cohesiveness in voice and style can crumble quickly.</p>
<p>This guide is intended to provide our content authors and editors specific parameters, principles and standards to ensure the website voice and style are consistently upheld and preserved.</p>
<h2>
	The Importance of a Unified Voice and Style</h2>
<p>Writing with a unified voice and style is important for all forms of communication. It’s especially important on the web because research indicates people scan web content.</p>
<ul><li>
		1/2 second or less--time for a reader to form a first impression of your content</li>
<li>
		15 seconds or less--average time spent on our web page</li>
<li>
		20%--amount of our content that someone will actually read on a page</li>
</ul><h3>
	AP Style</h3>
<p>Other than the specific principles outlined in this house guide, follow the AP Stylebook for fundamental guidelines on spelling, language, punctuation and word usage.</p>

<p>The web is a place for informality. It’s casual, conversational and it can be very personal.

		Limit the frequency with which we refer to ourselves and our organization in the third person.</li>
<li>
		Use first person plural “we” or “our” instead of third person.</li>

<p>One study finds that reading from computer screens is 25% slower than reading from print. That coupled with the fact that people scan on the web, rather than read, make it even more important to catch our employees’ attention with fewer words, tighter and pithier language.</p>
<ul><li>
		Eliminate words and sentences that don’t contribute to the main goal and focus</li>
<li>
		Keep webpages to 500 words or less with one main idea per page.</li>
<li>
		A webpage should be no more than half the length of a printed piece. Keep this in mind if you are translating from one medium (like print) to the web.</li>
<li>
		Write your content and then remove 50% of the words.</li>

				Use information-carrying images only</td>

				Visual bloat annoys users and distracts from the content on your page.   Images should serve a purpose if they are to be used.  Users pay attention to images that show content that’s relevant to the page content.  Also, avoid stock photos and use real people.</td>
</tr><tr><td>
				Use well structured content over files</td>
<td>
				Our users hate web files and prefer to scan content on the web to quickly find valuable information.  Structuring content within the website helps users feel comfortable searching through our content.  Downloadable files are seen as stop signs that are often avoided.  Structured content is also more usable on a variety of devices including: desktops, tablets, and phones.</td>

	File Principles</h3>
<p>Web files break the flow for our users.  To avoid linking files move file content into a well-structured web page.  Most users prefer to scan for information on a web page rather than reading a web file.  Web files like PDFs are great for one thing printing documents. Paper is superior to computer screens in many ways, and users often prefer to print documents that are too long to easily read online.</p>
<p><strong>Link PDF files:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
		For a print document that is too long to easily read online like an instructional manual or a book</li>
<li>
		For a form that requires a signature and must be printed</li>
</ul><p><strong>Things to Remember:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
		Avoid linking files with complex formatting over creating structured content this will frustrate our users.</li>
<li>
		Webpages can be printed but most people are accustomed to viewing information on a website.</li>
<li>
		Files often convert to a webpage faster than creating an accessible web file.</li>

	Image Principles</h3>
<p>Images are information-dense and quickly send a message to your audience.  Users focus their attention on images that represent the content but completely ignore decorative images.  Spend time to select images for your website that communicate your intended message. </p>
<h4>
	Image Selection Criterion</h4>
<p><strong>Appeal to your audience</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself, “Does the photo….</p>
<ul><li>
		show the benefit of reading your content?</li>
<li>
		create a desire in your user to read your content? </li>
<li>
		portray information to you user about the page content?</li>
</ul><p><strong>Strong composition</strong></p>
<p>Use photos that follow basic photography composition rules for exposure, contrast, cropping, balance, etc.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://wcmdemo7.sfsu.edu/academic/files/Image%20Composition.png" /></p>
<p class="small">Image subject with poor composition compared to a well composed image.</p>
<p><strong>Real People</strong></p>
<p>Photos of people creates a positive emotional connection with your users imprinting an impression of trustworthiness.  Avoid generic icons or decorative images.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://wcmdemo7.sfsu.edu/academic/files/Image%20People.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>Image Subject Directs Users to your content</strong></p>
<p>Users fixate on photo subjects’ eye gaze direction, gesture direction, and direction of motion.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://wcmdemo7.sfsu.edu/academic/files/Image%20Gesture.jpg" /></p>
<p class="small">Image subject points with his finger to the product and calls to action.  Image subject’s elbow pulls a user’s eye line down to supporting content.</p>
